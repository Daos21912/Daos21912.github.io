For this project I've taken up the challenge on drivendata.org about predicting damage to a building from an earthquake. The damage is categorized into minimal, substantial, and complete destruction. The competition can be found [here](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/57/nepal-earthquake/page/136/)

The data from the competition came already quite clean, and so there was minimal wrangling.
