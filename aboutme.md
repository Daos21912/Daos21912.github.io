My name is Dan Ferber. I am:

- currently a student at Lambda school in the data science program
- a PPG pilot.

What can I say? 

### My story

I graduated high school in 2005, and bounced around to a few colleges for a few years. I finally got my associates from Delaware County Community College in 2013, and moved on to Widener university, where I graduated with a degree in computer science in 2016. I went to work at a small company as a programmer, and found my hobby of flight, but the work quickly became unsatisfying. I wanted a change, and the pandemic cut my working hours, which allowed me to enroll in the program at Lambda school.
